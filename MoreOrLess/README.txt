Little application for the game "More or less" in console mode.
You are all welcome to use it and improve it, but please, PLEASE, add lots of comments just like me.
Also, before a method, use the /// resume to describe the method.

Probable futur improvement (not neccessarily in that order) :
- WPF mode
- silverlight
- i18n
